# Recursion is programming technique where a fucntion calls itself to solve problem Each recursive call should bring the problem closer to a base case,
# which is a condition that stops the recursion.
# Base Case: The condition under which the function stops calling itself. It prevents infinite recursion.
# Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with a simpler or smaller input.

Problem Statement: Directory Size Calculator
You are building a file management tool that needs to calculate the total size of a directory,
including all its nested subdirectories and files.
The directory structure is recursive in nature â€” a folder can contain files and other folders.
You need to recursively calculate the total size of all files within a directory tree.
